# First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

Now, take a moment to be sure your contributions make sense to everyone else. 
These are just guidelines, not rules. 
Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Reporting Issues

Found a problem? Want a new feature? First of all see if your issue or idea has already been reported. 
If don't, just open a new clear and descriptive issue.

*Any Pull Request not linked to an existing valid issue won't be reviewed.*


## Submitting pull requests

Pull requests are the greatest contributions, so be sure they are focused in scope, and do avoid unrelated commits.

- If the code is in an existing module, open a new branch to do the code you want to.
- If the code is not linked to an existing module, create one with a valid name.

When opening your PR, make sure the message respect the following convention

> {feat,fix,chore}(module_name): Short Description

For example `feat(usecase): Add a specific interface for error handling`

## Testing

Tests are good for everyone, please make sure your code is tested at least a little bit ;)
